# Description

CERTitude is a Python-based tool which aims at assessing the compromised perimeter during incident response assignments.
It allows analysts to perform large scale scans of Windows-based information systems by searching for behavioural patterns described in IOC (Indicator Of Compromise) files.

Notable features:
* Ability to scan hosts in a way that prevents the target workstation from knowing what the investigator is searching for
* Ability to retrieve some pieces of data from the hosts
* Multiple scanner instances (for IOCs and/or hash scans) can be run at the same time for parallel scanning
* Built with security considerations in mind (protected database, secure communications with hosts using IPSec)
